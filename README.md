# My Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This project showcases my web development skills and provides information about me. Below, you'll find a brief guide to the structure and features of the website.

## HTML Structure

### Home (Welcome Page)
A visually appealing landing page that welcomes visitors to my portfolio. It includes a prominent heading, a brief introduction, and a background image or illustration.

### About
In the "About Me" section, I've provided comprehensive information about myself, including my background, skills, interests, and relevant personal details. Also you can check my CV by clicking button on the page.

### Works
In the "Works" section, I showcase HTML and CSS projects that I've worked on during the course. Each project includes descriptions, and some may have links to project pages.

### Gallery
The "Gallery" section displays my personal photos or artwork using a grid layout or Flexbox to arrange the items.

### Contact
The "Contact" section provides my contact information, such as my phone number, email address, and links to my social media profiles (e.g., Instagram, LinkedIn). I've made it easy for visitors to get in touch with me.

## CSS Styling

I've applied CSS styles to create a visually appealing design. I've paid attention to typography, color schemes, spacing, and visual consistency to make the website visually appealing.

## CSS Layout Techniques

Flexbox is used to create flexible and visually appealing layouts for the sections. I've utilized Flexbox to align items in the header, arrange the CV sections, and display the gallery.

## Navigation

I've implemented a navigation menu that allows users to easily navigate between the different sections of the website. CSS transitions and other animations enhance the user experience.
